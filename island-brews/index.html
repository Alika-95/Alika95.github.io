   <h1>About Island Brews Coffee</h1>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    
    <P>Island Brews Coffee was founded in 2019 with a simple mission: bring the taste of Hawaii to every cup. We partner directly with small farms on the Big Island to source 100% Kona coffee beans. Every batch is roasted fresh at our local roastery and brewed with care by our trained baristas.</P>
    <p>What started as a small cart at the farmer’s market has grown into a beloved neighborhood gathering spot. But our commitment to quality and community hasn’t changed.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Sustainability</strong>— Eco-friendly packaging and practices</li>
    <Li><strong>Community</strong>— Supporting local farmers and artists</Li>
    <li><strong>Quality</strong>— Small-batch roasting for peak freshness</li>
    <li><strong>Aloha Spirit </strong>— Warm, welcoming atmosphere for everyone</li>
    </ul>
